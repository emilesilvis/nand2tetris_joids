# Joids

A joid is a friendly creature that flies around and has buddies.

A joid may do as it likes but always follows three rules:

1. Don't get too close to my buddies!
2. Steer towards the average position of my buddies!
3. Match my direction and speed to the average direction and speed of my buddies.

If all joids follow these three rules, magic happens.

See for yourself.

## How to Play

- Press 'j' to add a joid.
- Press 'k' to remove a joid.
- Press 'q' to quit.

## About

This is a boids simulation written in the Jack programming language for the Nand2Tetris course. Each joid starts at a random location with random velocity and follows the classic boids flocking algorithm.

The three rules create emergent flocking behavior - individual creatures following simple local rules result in complex group dynamics that resemble natural flocking, schooling, and swarming behaviors.

Watch as your joids learn to fly together!
